That's a common issue with Windows Server environments! Here are several ways to get JDK installed without using Internet Explorer:
Solution 1: Use PowerShell to Download
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
powershell# Create download directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\temp

# Download OpenJDK 8 (this is a direct download link)
$url = "https://github.com/adoptium/temurin8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u345-b01/OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_8u345b01.zip"
$output = "C:\temp\openjdk8.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $output

# Extract the JDK
Expand-Archive -Path $output -DestinationPath "C:\Program Files\Java\" -Force
Solution 2: Use Command Line (curl/wget alternative)
Windows Server might have curl available:
cmd# Check if curl is available
curl --version

# If available, download JDK
curl -L -o "C:\temp\openjdk8.zip" "https://github.com/adoptium/temurin8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u345-b01/OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_8u345b01.zip"
Solution 3: Use Another Browser
If available, try:

Edge: Usually available on Windows Server 2016
Chrome: If installed
Firefox: If installed

Open Command Prompt and type:
cmdstart msedge
# or
start chrome
# or
start firefox
Solution 4: Copy from Your Local Machine
Since it works on your local computer:

On your local machine, download JDK 8:

Go to Adoptium
Download OpenJDK 8 for Windows x64


Transfer to server using:

Remote Desktop copy/paste
Network share
USB drive
SCP/SFTP if available



Solution 5: Use Windows Package Manager (if available)
Check if winget is available:
cmdwinget --version
If available:
cmdwinget install Microsoft.OpenJDK.8
Solution 6: Extract from Existing Installation
If you have JDK on your local machine, you can copy the entire JDK folder:

On your local machine: Copy C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_XXX
On server: Paste to C:\Program Files\Java\

Recommended Steps:

Try PowerShell method first (Solution 1)
If that fails, use file transfer from your local machine (Solution 4)

After Getting JDK:

Extract/Install the JDK to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_XXX
Set JAVA_HOME:

cmdsetx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_XXX" /M
setx PATH "%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%" /M

Restart Command Prompt and test:

cmdjavac -version
mvn -version

Run your build:

cmdmvn clean install
Which approach would you prefer to try first? The PowerShell download method is usually the quickest if your server has internet access.
